# ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodeBuild and Terraform

This project demonstrates how to implement a full CI/CD pipeline using **AWS CodeBuild** to automatically deploy infrastructure using **Terraform**. The setup provisions a VPC, subnet, security groups, and an EC2 instance â€” with the public IP displayed as an output. The pipeline is triggered on **GitHub push and pull request merge events**.
